# AirportAnalysis
Using C++ in Replit, we took a csv dataset containing 384 entries of airport codes, locations, distances, and cost values, and converted it into a graph data structure by creating a vector representing each airport and an adjacency matrix where each edge is a flight. We used Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest path between 2 airports
