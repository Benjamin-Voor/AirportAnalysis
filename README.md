# Graph-Based Airport Connectivity and Flight Route Optimization System in C++
### Instructor: Dr. Paniz Abedin
### Semester: Spring 2024
### Course Name: Data Structures & Algorithms
### Course ID: COP3415
### By: Brian Tran, Robert Baumgarten, and Benjamin Voor
Using C++ in Replit, we took a csv dataset containing 384 entries of airport codes, locations, distances, and cost values, and converted it into a graph data structure by creating a vector representing each airport and an adjacency matrix where each edge is a flight. We used Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest path between 2 airports

## Skills
* Group academic project with live collaboration 
* C++
* Data Structures
* Object-Oriented Programming
* Replit app, with live collaboration (which was copied-and-pasted into a GitHub repository)

## Presentation
Our project's project description was assigned in `Assignment.pdf`, and we presented our project to the class using the PowerPoint file called `Graph-Based Airport Connectivity and Flight Route Optimization System.pptx`

## Instructions
We uploaded everything to https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler or replit.com to run it.
